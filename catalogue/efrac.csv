Maron_2000,0.5,"p197: We try to circumvent this unpleasant situation by estimating errors for the pulsar flux densities in our sample from published values, wherever available, and standard deviations of the average of single measurements."

Dembska_2014,,"p3106: Most sources in our sample have high DMs and hence the flux-density variations caused by interstellar scintillations should be minimal. Nevertheless, observations at each frequency (with a few exceptions) were conducted at two to three different epochs to give us reliable estimates of the average flux and its uncertainties, which are used to construct the spectra for these pulsars, in combination with flux-density data available from the literature."
Stovall_2014,,
